Hi
In this video we are going to describe the RiskID application.

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.965
To start using RiskID you need get an user account. Let's do it.

00:00:07.917 --> 00:00:12.169
Go to the end of user manual page and click Sign Up button.

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:19.223
Fill all field in form, submit it and log in.

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.730
Welcome to RiskID application.

00:00:56.491 --> 00:01:04.721
This page show in left the Connection List. All connections were regrouped by their similarity.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:20.827
There is three group easily identifiable by their different background color in the list.

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:32.900
Each connection in the list, from left to right, display information about their current label:
red circle to botnet, green circle to normal and yellow circle to unlabeled.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.765
Next to it the index number of the connection in the list is displayed.

00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:50.476
Followed appears a color representation for three feature in the connection:
periodicity (represented by orange), duration (represented by green) and size (represented by blue).

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.483
The intensity in the color represents the high or low presence of the characteristics in the connection.

00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:07.838
If you clicked a connection in the list more information about that will be displayed in right section.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:30.047
A bar chart display the connection symbol distribution, and a pie chart show connection periodicity feature.

00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:25.340
When an unlabeled connection is selected the detailed block display both
the botnet and normal label connection more close to selected connection.

00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:50.350
To select a label for unlabeled connection two buttons are in the bottom of each connection view.

00:03:53.644 --> 00:04:05.834
Red button to botnet label and green button to normal label.

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:30.669
You can also filter connections in the list using some options on top.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:50.529
Once your task over, you could download the resultant labeled dataset doing clicked on the "Save Labeling" button.

00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:56.054
Thanks a lot for your contribution to this work.
