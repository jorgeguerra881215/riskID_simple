Hi
In this video we are going to describe the RiskID application.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:06,965
To start using RiskID you need get an user account. Let's do it.

3
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:12,169
Go to the end of user manual page and click Sign Up button.

4
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:19,223
Fill all field in form, submit it and log in.

5
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,730
Welcome to RiskID application.

6
00:00:56,491 --> 00:01:04,721
This page show in left the Connection List. All connections were regrouped by their similarity.

7
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:20,827
There is three group easily identifiable by their different background color in the list.

8
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:32,900
Each connection in the list, from left to right, display information about their current label:
red circle to botnet, green circle to normal and yellow circle to unlabeled.

9
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,765
Next to it the index number of the connection in the list is displayed.

10
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:50,476
Followed appears a color representation for three feature in the connection:
periodicity (represented by orange), duration (represented by green) and size (represented by blue).

11
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:58,483
The intensity in the color represents the high or low presence of the characteristics in the connection.

12
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:07,838
If you clicked a connection in the list more information about that will be displayed in right section.

13
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:30,047
A bar chart display the connection symbol distribution, and a pie chart show connection periodicity feature.

14
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:25,340
When an unlabeled connection is selected the detailed block display both
the botnet and normal label connection more close to selected connection.

15
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:50,350
To select a label for unlabeled connection two buttons are in the bottom of each connection view.

16
00:03:53,644 --> 00:04:05,834
Red button to botnet label and green button to normal label.

17
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:30,669
You can also filter connections in the list using some options on top.

18
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:50,529
Once your task over, you could download the resultant labeled dataset doing clicked on the "Save Labeling" button.

19
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:54,054
Good Luck !!!
